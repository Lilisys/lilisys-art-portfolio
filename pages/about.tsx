          Lilisys is a mostly self-taught Michigan based painter who enjoys experimenting with both digital and traditional media. She paints a variety of subjects including characters from TV shows, video games, and anime, as well as landscapes of places she's visited. Lilisys is constantly experimenting with styles and improving her craft, and lately sheâ€™s found enjoyment working with watercolor and gouache. When Lilisys isn't painting, you can find her coding, playing video games, or crafting costumes for conventions.
